**Project Title:** Predicting a Pulsar Star

**Description:**
Pulsars are rare neutron stars that emit detectable radio waves, offering significant insights into space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter. Leveraging their unique properties, including dense composition and precise rotational periods, we can utilize them to explore various astrophysical phenomena.

In my project, I used supervised machine learning algorithms to predict whether a star is a pulsar. This comprehensive analysis included:

- **Data Analysis:** Initial exploration and preprocessing of data.
- **Logistic Regression:** Building a binary classifier.
- **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) Classification:** Implementing a distance-based approach.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification:** Utilizing hyperplanes for classification.
- **Naive Bayes Classification:** Applying probabilistic models.
- **Decision Tree Classification:** Creating tree-based models for decision making.
- **Random Forest Classification:** Enhancing decision trees with ensemble methods.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.

This project provided valuable experience in applying various machine learning techniques to solve problems in the realm of astrophysics.
